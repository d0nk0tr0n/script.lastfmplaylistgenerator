# script.lastfmplaylistgenerator
Kodi Plugin - LastFMPlaylistGenerator (emulates Apple iTunes Genius)

This kodi addon generates a genuis-like playlist based on the currently playing track. The addon needs partymode disabled, so the first time launching, it will prompt to disable partymode, then run the addon again. The second time, it will prompt to select a song. This will be the seed that populates the playlist. As it plays, additional songs will be added based on the various scrobbles to Last.FM.
